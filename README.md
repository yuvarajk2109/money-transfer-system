# Money Transfer System - Full Stack Banking Application

## Overview

Money Transfer System is a full stack financial transaction platform built with **Spring Boot (backend)** and **Angular (frontend)**. The system supports secure user account management, fund transfers, transaction tracking, administrative workflows, analytics, and rollback management for financial safety.

The application follows a role based architecture:

* **User**

  * Account registration
  * Money transfer
  * Transaction history
  * Rollback request initiation
  * Profile management

* **Admin**

  * Account approval and rejection
  * Deposit management
  * System-wide transaction monitoring
  * Rollback approval or rejection
  * Analytics dashboard

The system is designed around clean separation of concerns, modular Angular components, and REST driven backend services.

## Shared Components

### Confirm Dialog

Reusable modal used for:

* Logout confirmation
* Rollback request confirmation
* Admin rollback approval or rejection

Configurable via inputs:

* title
* message
* confirmText
* cancelText

---

### Pagination Component

* Generic reusable paginator
* Used across:

  * Transactions
  * Approvals
  * Rollbacks

---

### Date Picker

* Custom calendar component
* Controlled opening
* Click outside to close
* Theme aware

---

## Important Implementation Notes

### Angular Response Parsing

Some endpoints return plain text instead of JSON.

Example:

```
Rollback request submitted successfully
```

Angular requires:

```ts
{ responseType: 'text' }
```

to avoid parsing errors.

---

### Change Detection Strategy

Manual change detection is used where necessary:

```ts
this.cdr.detectChanges();
```

Applied after async state updates and modal state transitions.

---

## Security Considerations

* JWT based authentication
* Guard protected routes
* Role based access control
* Backend authorization enforcement
* Idempotency key for transfer safety

---

## Running the Project

### Backend

```
mvnw spring-boot:run
```

or

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Backend runs on:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

---

### Frontend

```
npm install
ng serve
```

Frontend runs on:

```
http://localhost:4200
```

---

## Future Improvements

* WebSocket based live updates
* Advanced analytics charts
* Transaction search and export
* Audit logs
* Notification system
* Optimistic state management with signals
* Improved state store architecture

---

## Summary
