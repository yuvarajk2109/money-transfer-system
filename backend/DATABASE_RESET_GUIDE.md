# Database Reset and Setup Guide

## Problem
The hardcoded BCrypt hashes in seed-data.sql are not working properly.

## Solution
The application now **automatically creates the admin user** when it starts for the first time!

## Steps to Reset and Start Fresh

### 1. Reset the Database

Run this script in MySQL Workbench to drop and recreate the tables:

**File:** `database/reset-database.sql`

```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire reset-database.sql file into MySQL Workbench and execute
```

This will:
- Drop the existing `accounts` and `transaction_logs` tables
- Recreate them fresh and empty

### 2. Start the Application

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

OR

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### 3. Admin User Auto-Created!

When the application starts, it will **automatically create** the admin user using the credentials from your environment variables:

```
=
DEFAULT ADMIN USER CREATED
Email: <your ADMIN_EMAIL>
=
```

You'll see this message in the console logs.

### 4. Login as Admin

Go to: http://localhost:8080/login.html

Use the admin email and password you configured in your `.env` file.

### 5. Add Users via Frontend

Now you can register new users through the frontend:

1. Go to http://localhost:8080/register.html
2. Fill in the registration form
3. Login as admin
4. Approve the new user
5. The user can now login!

## Configuration

The admin credentials are loaded from environment variables (see `.env`):

```yaml
admin:
  default:
    email: ${ADMIN_EMAIL:admin@system.com}
    password: ${ADMIN_PASSWORD}
    name: ${ADMIN_NAME:System Administrator}
```

Set these values in your `.env` file before starting the application.

## How It Works

1. On application startup, `AdminUserInitializer` runs
2. It checks if an admin user exists in the database
3. If not, it creates one with the credentials from `application.yaml`
4. The password is automatically BCrypt-encoded by the application
5. The admin user is saved to the database

## Benefits

✅ No need to manually generate BCrypt hashes
✅ No need to run separate SQL scripts for seed data
✅ Works every time, guaranteed
✅ Password is properly BCrypt-encoded by the application
✅ Easy to change admin credentials in config file

## Troubleshooting

**Admin user not created?**
- Check the console logs for errors
- Verify MySQL is running and accessible
- Check `application.yaml` database credentials

**Can't login with admin credentials?**
- Make sure you see the "DEFAULT ADMIN USER CREATED" message in logs
- Check the database: `SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE email='admin@system.com';`
- Verify the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var matches what you're typing

**Want to recreate the admin user?**
1. Run `reset-database.sql` again
2. Restart the application
3. Admin user will be recreated
